# SPOJSolutions

[**SPOJ**](https://www.spoj.com/) stands for **S**phere **O**nline **J**udge, and it's a platform created for those who want to learn and practise programming.

This repository contains some of the problems found on the SPOJ website. Those are not necessarily the best solutions, but they can be useful if anyone gets stuck while solving these or similar problems.

All of the solutions in this repository are written using C++ language. For IDE I used [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) and GCC compiler.
